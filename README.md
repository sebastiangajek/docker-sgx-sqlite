# Intel SGX SQLite Demo

This repository demonstrates the use of SQLite within an Intel SGX enclave. It provides preconfigured Dockerfiles to run the demo in hardware mode on a CPU with SGX support or in simulation mode in case no such hardware is available on the system. Further instructions can be found within the respective folders.
